            <h2>Love for music</h2>
            <p>I've grown up around an environment where there was always music or some form of it. The family I grew up were artist's themselves my father along with his brothers had a group named <b>KLS</b>
            they were one of the first Hmong groups in America and they continued to set a foundation to the sound of Hmong music so that it was on par with the modern sound.</p>

            <h2>Places I would like to visit in my life.</h2>
            <p>I've always wanted to go to Japan. I have a deep interest into their history and the Sengoku Period when the great clans were fighting to become Shogun. East Asia much like Japan, Korea, China, they are all places I would like to see in my lifetime.</p>
